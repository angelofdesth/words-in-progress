                hi! welcome to words in progress! 
                the idea for this site came from my chronic
                starting and not finishing of blog posts. 
                it's such a shame, i thought, and i realized that 
                i should still put these drafts on display, even 
                though they're not done. they're just some words 
                in progress :D
            </span>
        </div>
    </div>
